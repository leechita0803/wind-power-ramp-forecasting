An end-to-end machine learning framework for **8-hour wind power forecasting** and **wind ramp detection** using **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)**, **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**, and an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

The project focuses on detecting significant wind power ramp events while maintaining reliable short-term forecasting performance. It implements the methodology presented in the associated research publication and provides an interactive dashboard for analysing forecasting results, decomposition components, and ramp detection metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview

Wind power generation is highly variable due to changing weather conditions. Sudden increases or decreases in power output, known as **wind ramp events**, can significantly affect power system stability and grid operations.

This project proposes a hybrid forecasting framework that:

- Decomposes the wind power signal using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)
- Predicts each Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) using XGBoost regression
- Reconstructs the final wind power forecast
- Detects wind ramp events using a Definition-Based Sign Indicator (DSI)
- Visualises results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard
